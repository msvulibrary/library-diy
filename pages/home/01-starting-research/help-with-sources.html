  <strong>First consider the purpose of your sources.</strong>
</p>
<p>What do you hope to accomplish by using sources? Some common reasons you might use sources in your own work include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>to show how your voice enters into an intellectual conversation.</li>
  <li>to communicate your understanding of an issue and your credibility.</li>
  <li>to inspire and enrich your own ideas.</li>
  <li>to acknowledge the work of others.</li>
  <li>to connect readers to related research</li>
</ul>
<br>
  <strong>When using sources for research assignments...</strong>
</p>
<p>you'll want to see if certain types of sources are required or recommended by your instructor. Some professors require you to use only scholarly peer-reviewed journals, primary sources, newspapers, or books from the library, while others might leave things more open-ended.</p>
