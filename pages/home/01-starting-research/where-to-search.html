<h3>What type(s) of sources might you need?</h3>

<p>Does your assignment recommend certain source types (e.g. peer-reviewed articles, newspaper articles, data, books, videos)? What role do sources play in the project?</p>

<p>Depending on the topic, you might look for books, articles, media coverage, or other online sources.  If your topic is very new, there may not be many books or scholarly articles because scholarly works can have a long publication process.</p>

<h3>Who has written about / discussed your topic?</h3>

<p>A topic like "race relations in prisons" might be explored by scholars in sociology, law, criminal justice, public policy, psychology, or ethnic studies. Search by discipline or your academic field by using the databases and other library resources recommended in the <a href="https://libguides.msvu.ca">Subject Guides</a>.</p>
